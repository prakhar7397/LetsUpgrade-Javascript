DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR, LET AND CONST

[1]var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
 VAR : var greeter = "hey hi";
    
       function newFunction()
        {
       var hello = "hello";
        }

LET :   let greeting = "say Hi";
        let times = 4;

        if (times > 3)
         {
        let hello = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
        }
        console.log(hello) // hello is not defined 

CONST : {
        const abc="prakhar";    
        console.log(abc);
        }

[2]var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
 VAR : var greeter = "hey hi";          //ALLOWED
       var greeter = "say Hello instead";

       var greeter = "hey hi";
       greeter = "say Hello instead";   //ALLOWED

LET :  let greeting = "say Hi";         //ALLOWED
       greeting = "say Hello instead";   

       let greeting = "say Hi";
       let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

CONST : const greeting = "say Hi";
        greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.

        const greeting = "say Hi";
    const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

[3]They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
 VAR :  console.log (greeter);
        var greeter = "say hello"
      IS INTERPRETED AS 
        var greeter;
        console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
        greeter = "say hello"    

LET : JUST LIKE VAR, EXCEPT IT'S NOT INITIALIZED.

[4]While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
